# Self Evaluation

**- What did you struggle with in this section?**
*Oddly enought this section about hashes really just clicked for me. I think I do need to remember that .each can be used here and if statements too...for those final tasks I had to refer to my notes. Overall, I feel confident today.*

**- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?**
*So... I've been going back and forth on this. I had a notebook with a sprial at the top but it's NOT working well, so yesterday I bought one with the spiral on the side. However, not that we're nearly done with Mod0, I decided to wait and rewrite all my notes and go through the lessons again during our break weeks before Mod1. This way it'll help solidify the learning and have clean/clear reference pages. Oh, and I take the most useful notes when I'm learning alone and reading through the lessons. During class I jot down things that are not on the lesson pages though. What I have been doing is leaving space to write notes I know I'll need on the page, with the useful teacher comments...then after our online lesson I review the text we went through. The only draw back on this is that it takes additional time. I'll have to find the balance.*

**- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?**
*I'm definately NOT a learn-by-discover type of person when it comes to things that already have an answer (such as math, cooking, or coding). However, if it have some kind of clue to the answer I try out different things, then if it's still not working I consult The Google! If, on the other hand, I have not clue what the solution might be... Hi-Ho, Hi-Ho, directly to Google I go! *
